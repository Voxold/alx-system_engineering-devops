<h1>HairlineGenius API System Crash Occurrence Report</h1>
<h5>By the HairlineGenius API project team.</h5>
<h3>Issue Summary</h3>
<p>On August 12, 2023, from 12:00pm WAT to 12:55pm WAT, all requests to all HairlineGenius APIs gave a 500 error response messages. This resulted in the disruption of operations for 75% of the companies relying on HairlineGenius API infrastructures during this time of day. The root cause of the breakdown was an untested software package that was integrated into the system's internal framework.</p>
<h3>Timeline (WAT)</h3>
1 - 11:49 AM: Time of the configuration push.
2 - 12:00 PM: Time of the outage.
3 - 12:00 PM: Teams were alerted by the pagers.
4 - 12:50 PM: Software package push was successfully withdrawn.
5 - 12:51 PM: Servers restarted.
6 - 12:55 PM: 100% traffic came back online.
<h3>Root Cause and Resolution</h3>
<p>By 11:49 PM WAT on August 12, 2023, a software package was published and pushed to our internal backend system without undergoing testing procedures. This action conflicted with an existing deployed package, resulting in server crashes and queuing of traffic. At 12:00 PM WAT, our monitoring system promptly alerted our team, who identified and resolved the issue by 12:50 PM WAT.</p>
<h3>Corrective and Preventative Measures</h3>
Following the successful withdrawal, we conducted an intensive internal investigation and analysis of the system crash. The following measures helped fix the system crash:

Disabling the direct pushing mechanism until proper tests are carried out on the software package.
Enhancing the withdrawal process to be quicker and more robust.
Setting up prompt mail forwarding to users upon noticing abnormal behavior of the system.
Developing a better mechanism for quickly delivering status notifications during incidents.
HairlineGenius will continuously improve its technology and functioning to ensure that users get the best hair services available online through its collaboration with third-party hair companies worldwide. We once again apologize for the halt in transactions caused by the system crash. We thank you for your steady patronage and support.

Sincerely, The HairlineGenius API Project Team.
